YOLO-ETA (Luna 9) Jupyter Notebook Project

Welcome to our YOLO-ETA (Luna 9) Jupyter Notebook project! This README file accompanies our article 'Possible Identification of the Luna 9 Moon Landing Site Using a Novel Machine Learning Algorithm' by Pinault et al. 2025.

This repository contains:

-- The YOLO-ETA Jupyter Notebook, YOLO_ETA.ipynb -- The YOLO-ETA trained model for running in the Jupyter Notebook, using the Turi Create Library, in a folder titled YOLO-ETA -- A sample test image to try, in the folder test_images -- Labels to match the test image, in a file named labels_test.json

Getting Started To get started with the YOLO-ETA notebook, you'll need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. If you don't have Jupyter yet, you can install it by following the instructions on the Jupyter Project website, https://jupyter.org/install

We recommend using a virtual environment to use, install, or build Turi Create. Note that currently Turi Create requires Python < 3.8

To install Turi Create in the new virtual environment, do the following:

pip install -U turicreate
